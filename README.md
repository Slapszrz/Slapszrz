<h1>Hey thereüòÅ!</h1>
<p>I'm Slaps_zrz, a software developer using GitHub to track his projects.</p>

<h2>About me‚úå</h2>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am a currently 16yo software engineer, living in Coburg, Germany.<b3/> As a Trainee in computer science, programming is also my Job.</p>

<h4>My Experienceüí°</h4>
<p>While currently working much in JavaScript/React, I have experience in many different topics like
  <ul>
    <li>Godot game engine</li>
    <li>Java (especially with SpringBoot)</li>
    <li>Oracle & PL/SQL</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>plain HTML + CSS + JS</li>
  </ul>
  and more languages/tools/systems I've worked with, e.g. my small server-system at home for personal uses or a display out of 2 of these <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/rgb-matrix-p3-64x64.htm">matrix displays</a> powered by a RaspberryPI.
</p>

<h4>My workspaceüë®‚Äçüíª</h4>
<p>While working under Windows 11, these tools are a MUST HAVE for me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>VSCode for most of my code</li>
  <li>IntelliJ Ultimate to work in Java and because of the good git tools</li>
  <li>Firefox is my main browser (solid developer tools, simple design)</li>
  <li>Discord/Teams for communication</li>
  <li>Putty & WinSCP for SSH connections</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Projectsü§©:</h2>
<h3><a href="https://tls.chat">TLSChat</a></h3>
<div>
  <p>The project I'm currently spending much of my time on is <a href="https://github.com/TLSChat">TLSChat</a>, especially on the <a href="https://github.com/TLSChat/WebClient">WebClient</a>.</p>
  <p>TLSChat is a simple Chat Platform, developed by <a href="https://github.com/FusseligerDev">@FusseligerDev</a> and, of course, me :^), while <a href="https://github.com/Senshyn">@Senshyn</a> writes our <a href="https://coda.io/d/Dokumentation-tls-chat_dS5d24P2ri5/">documentation</a>.<br/> In case you want to chat with me, just open TLSChat, create a new account when you don't have on yet and write me: @Slaps_zrz!</p>
  <div>
    <h4>The <a href="https://github.com/TLSChat/WebClient">WebClient</a></h4>
    <p>Whilst being my biggest project yet, the WebClient is the main frontend part of TLSChat.<br/>
      This Browser Application is fully developed in <a href="https://react.dev/">ReactJS</a>, the JavaScript framework I enjoy most working with.
